# rate_filter provides rate based attack prevention by allowing users to
# configure a new action to take for a specified time when a given rate is
# exceeded.  Multiple rate filters can be defined on the same rule, in which case
# they are evaluated in the order they appear in the configuration file, and the
# first applicable action is taken.  

# Rate filters are used as standalone commands (outside any rule) and have the
# following format:

# rate_filter \
#     gen_id <gid>, sig_id <sid>, \
#     track <by_src|by_dst|by_rule>, \
#     count <c>, seconds <s>, \
#     new_action alert|drop|pass|log|sdrop|reject, \
#     timeout <seconds>, \
#     apply_to <ip-list>

# This format has the following options - all are required except apply_to, which
# is optional:

# * Track by_src|by_dst|by_rule:  rate is tracked either by source IP address,
#   destination IP address, or by rule.  This means the match statistics are
#   maintained for each unique source IP address, for each unique destination IP
#   address, or they are aggregated at rule level.  For rules related to Stream5
#   sessions, source and destination means client and server respectively.  track
#   by_rule and apply_to may not be used together.

# * Count c:  the maximum number of rule matches in s seconds before the rate
#   filter limit to is exceeded.  C must be positive.

# * seconds s:  the time period over which count is accrued. 0 seconds means
#   count is a total count instead of a specific rate.  For example, rate filter
#   may be used to detect if the number of connections to a specific server
#   exceed a specific count.  0 seconds only applies to internal rules (gen_id 135)
#   and other use will produce a fatal error by Snort.

# * new_action <alert|drop|pass|log|sdrop|reject>:  new_action replaces rule
#   action with alert|drop| pass|log|sdrop for r (timeout) seconds.  Drop, reject
#   and sdrop can be used only when snort is used in inline mode.  sdrop and
#   reject are conditionally compiled with #ifdef GIDS.

# * timeout r:  revert to the original rule action after r seconds.  If r is 0,
#   then rule action is never reverted back.  Event filter may be used to manage
#   number of alerts after the rule action is enabled by rate filter.

# * apply_to <ip-list>:  restrict the configuration to only to source or
#   destination IP address (indicated by track parameter) determined by
#   <ip-list>.  track by_rule and apply_to may not be used together.  Note that
#   events are generated during the timeout period, even if the rate falls below
#   the configured limit.  


# Example - allow a maximum of 100 connection attempts per second from any one
# IP address, and block further connection attempts from that IP address for 10
# seconds:

# rate_filter \
#     gen_id 135, sig_id 1, \
#     track by_src, \
#     count 100, seconds 1, \
#     new_action drop, timeout 10
